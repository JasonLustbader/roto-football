## Feature List

### Calculate score across multiple categories

### Teams can have more players than there are positions to fill

Each team in a league has a fixed number of positions (running backs, quarter back, etc.) for a season, agreed upon by the league. A team's "active lineup" is defined as the players assigned to each position for that week. If there are more players on a team than positions, players that don't fit into a position for a week must be "inactive".

An "inactive" player's scores (from the actual game) do not impact the team's score for the week.  The active and inactive players for a team can change from week to week.
